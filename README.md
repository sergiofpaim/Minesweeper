# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game made with C# and windows forms
Pre-College study #3

# About this study exercise
This game was my third coding exercise, it was created to help me understand how do manage recursive loops, arrays and lists in C#.
## Previous stage
I had just created a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

### Challenge 
My challenge was to create my own Minesweeper game from scratch. For that, I had to look for ways to write the rules of the game in C# code in the most simplified way.
### Concepts Learned
I learned how to deal with long multidimensional arrays and how to create recursive functions in C#. I also improved my understanding of encapsulation while programming this game.
### Next Stage
My next step is to create a 2D car game, to better understand how to apply motion, schedulers and physics in games.
